### MiniTwitTests


## How to run the tests:
1. Start the server in test mode by going to `itu-minitwit-cs` and running `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Test dotnet run`
2. Execute the test by running `dotnet test` in the `MiniTwitTests` directory

After every test run the server must be restarted to reset the database.
